# Student Performance Analysis

This is my first project in Github. There is a dataset that I am working on called Student Performance Analysis. It has grades relating to two Portuguese schools, and demographics and social habits as some other variables. I am going to upload code relating to SQL, Tableau, and R.

## Project Structure

- **Raw_Data folder**  
  This folder consists of the data files used for the analysis.

- **Student_Performance.sql**  
  This is the SQL file consisting of most of the queries that were executed during the analysis of the code. Some of the queries disappeared because of a computer crash, but the data table was undisturbed.

- **Book1.twb**  
  This file is the first iteration of the Tableau analysis of the student performance data. It will be updated in time with new and cleaner dashboards and sheets.

- **R-Markdown analysis (coming soon)**  
  An R-Markdown analysis will also be added shortly, including analyses such as regression analysis.
