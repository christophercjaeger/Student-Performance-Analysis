This is my first project in Github. There is a dataset that I working on called Student Performance Analysis. It has grades relating to two Portugeuse Schools, and demopgrahics and social habits as some other variables. I am going to upload code relating to SQL, Tableau and R. 

The Raw_Data folder consists of the data files used for the analysis.

Student_Performance.sql is the SQL File consisting of some of the most of the queries that were excecuted during the analysis of the code. Some of the queries dissappeared because of a computer crash, but the data table was undisturbed. 

The 'Book1.twb' file is the first iteration of the Tableau analysis of the student performance data. It will be updated in time with new and cleaner dashboards and sheets. 

A R-Markdown analysis will also be added shortly, including analyses such as regression analysis.
